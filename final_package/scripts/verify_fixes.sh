## Key Features

1. **Ride Comparison**
   - Compare prices and ETAs across multiple services
   - Sort rides by price or ETA
   - Find the best ride based on price, ETA, and driver rating

2. **inDrive Offer System**
   - Send offers for inDrive rides
   - Receive and respond to counter-offers
   - Track offer status

3. **Driver Mode**
   - View available ride requests
   - Accept or reject requests
   - Track earnings

4. **Egyptian Ride-Hailing Services Integration**
   - Integration with all major Egyptian ride-hailing services
   - Support for local pricing and currency
   - Arabic language support

## Building the Application

To build the application, run the updated build script:

\`\`\`
./scripts/updated_build_apk.sh
\`\`\`

This will generate an APK file at \`/home/ubuntu/cruzo.apk\`.

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive tests for all key features. To run the tests, use:

\`\`\`
./scripts/run_tests.sh
\`\`\`

Test results will be available in the \`/home/ubuntu/test_output\` directory.

## Debugging

If you encounter any issues, check the log files in the \`/home/ubuntu/test_output\` directory for detailed information.
